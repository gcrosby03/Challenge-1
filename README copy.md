# Horiseon Marketing Agency Refactoring

## The Task
For this refactoring i was tasked to make the website more accessible to people with disabilities. To make this website more accessible it should:

1. GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
1. WHEN I view the source code
1. THEN I find semantic HTML elements
1. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
1. THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and 1. positioning
1. WHEN I view the icon and image elements
1. THEN I find accessible alt attributes
1. WHEN I view the heading attributes
1. THEN they fall in sequential order
1. WHEN I view the title element
1. THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## What Did I Do

First i started with the .html adding alt descriptions and arranged the body in an orderly fashion.

Then, i assessed the style page and seen some things were done multiple times and could be combined into one command. 


Added some comments to certain commands to describe what was happening.

Also i needed to delete 1 class that wasn't even in the .html.

I rearranged the CSS page to be more orderly.

This is the *[Deployable Link]()*.
